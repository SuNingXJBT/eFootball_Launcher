If you prefer to play this game in window mode, this tiny tool will help you :

1. Simulate 21:9 ultrawide screen on  16:9 monitor.  Turn your 32" 16:9 monitor into 29" 21:9 ultrawide one.
2.Run it after MS or Steam eFootball has started. Or use it to launch Steam eFootball.
3. Press b to toggle window borders
4. parameter 0 means a mini window for farming. 
5. run as Administrator


Usage: efootball-launcher_Q143552766.exe ratio-of-monitor-height.

To simulate a 21:9 ultrawide screen on 16:9 monitor, the ratio-of-monitor-height should be 0.76.

" efootball-launcher_Q143552766.exe 0.5  "  means height of eFootball is half of the monitor height.

Parameter 0 means a mini window for farming. https://t.me/efootballCheaterReport/111
        
Running without parameter will only enable eFootball's MINIMIZEBOX and MAXIMIZEBOX
